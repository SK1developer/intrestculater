## 🧮 Formula Used

- **Simple Interest**:  
  \[
  SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
  \]

- **Compound Interest** (Monthly compounding):  
  \[
  CI = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{12})^{n} - P
  \]

Where:
- `P` = Principal
- `R` = Annual Rate (%)
- `T` = Time in years
- `r` = Rate / 100
- `n` = Time in months
